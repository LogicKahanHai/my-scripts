# My Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I have written to automate tasks that I do frequently.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are not tested for different systems. They are written for my personal use and may not work for you. Use them at your own risk.

## List of Scripts

1. [**`gac`**](./gac): This script is used to add all files, commit them with a message and push them to the remote repository. It has a simple UI for you to choose the files to add and commit.
2. [**`nmux`**](./nmux): This script is used to create new [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) sessions. It has a simple UI for you to choose the session name and the project directory and other options. **Disclaimer**: This script, specifically, has my own folder structure hard-coded and may not work for you.
